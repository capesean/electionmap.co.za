=====================

Election Map lets you visualise the 2009 South African National Elections data on a map.



Code4SA Overview
----------------

Election Map uses mapper.js (http://www.capesean.co.za/mapper) to visualise election data retrieved from the http://iec.code4sa.org/ api.

There are 4 indicators:

* Winning Party
* Winning Margin
* Party Base
* Part Strength

The results of the indicators can be viewed at the following levels:

* Provincial
* Municipal
* Ward

Clicking a 'shape' will show a table with the appropriate results.

More information is available on the website popup, or by clicking the "?" icon.

To view the website, see: http://www.electionmap.co.za

(Adi - we've done our best to keep the number of api calls to a minimum by storing the results; hope your server is ok, though!)
